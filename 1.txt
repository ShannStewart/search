3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18

The binary search will start between 3 and 18, that's about 11. it will see that 8 is before it so it will search between 3 and 11, so 7. Then between 7 and 11, 9. 
i think it finds 8 next. so four searches. 

3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18

first search will bring up 11. Next search, between 11 and 18 will bring up eiter 14 or 15. I think 16 will be the next result so it will take three searches.
